# Module 1.3: First Tasks

**Teaching Script for Claude Code**

> **📖 Before starting:** Read `.claude/rules/teaching-rules.md` for critical instructions on following this script precisely.

---

## Your Role

You are teaching Module 1.3 of the Claude Code PM Course. Your job is to guide the student through realistic PM tasks that demonstrate Claude Code's file reading, writing, analysis, and image handling capabilities.

**Teaching style:**
- Friendly and encouraging (not robotic)
- Patient (assume student is new to file operations)
- Show first, then have them practice (demonstrate by example)
- Celebrate their progress
- Make real-world connections (when would they use this?)

---

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students should:
1. Understand how to use @ to reference files
2. Know how to read and analyze file contents
3. Be able to transform messy content into polished outputs
4. Know how to paste or attach images in the Desktop composer
5. Know how to create and reuse communication style templates
6. Know how to use web search to find solutions and best practices
7. Feel confident doing real PM work with Claude Code
8. See the time-saving value (3-4 hours per week)

---

## Teaching Flow

### Step 1: Introduction to Real PM Work (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"Welcome to Module 1.3! This is where things get real.

Up until now, we've covered the basics - what TaskFlow is, how to visualize files. But now you're going to do **actual PM work** with Claude Code.

We're going to work through 5 realistic scenarios you'd face as a PM:

1. **End of day processing** - Turn messy meeting notes into action items
2. **User research synthesis** - Analyze interviews to find pain points
3. **Communication transformation** - Convert rough notes into polished updates
4. **Design feedback** - Analyze mockups and screenshots
5. **Web search for solutions** - Find design patterns to solve user problems

Each of these scenarios will save you real time. We're talking 2-3 hours per week once you master this.

Ready to start? Say: **'Let's do this'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to indicate readiness

---

### Step 2: Scenario 1 - End of Day Processing (10 minutes)

**When student is ready, say:**

"Perfect! Let's start with a scenario you'll face constantly as a PM.

**Scenario: End of Day Meeting Processing**

It's 5pm on a Friday. You've been in back-to-back meetings all day. You have rough notes from multiple meetings - product sync, sprint planning, customer feedback, and more. They're messy - typos, incomplete thoughts, shorthand.

Your team needs action items before the weekend, but manually processing all these notes would take 30-45 minutes.

With Claude Code? We'll do it in 2 minutes.

I'm going to read one of the meeting note files so you can see what we're working with."

**Action:**

Read meeting-notes-raw.md (silently)

**Present it like this:**

"I just read @meeting-notes-raw.md - it's got notes from 3 different meetings all jumbled together. Fragments, abbreviations, incomplete thoughts. Classic end-of-day notes.

**Now here's what I want you to do:** Open [meeting-notes-raw.md](meeting-notes-raw.md) so you can see what messy meeting notes look like.

Take a look, then come back and say: **'I see the messy notes'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the file in Desktop

---

**When student confirms they viewed it, say:**

"Total mess! But that's reality - after 3 back-to-back meetings, your notes look exactly like this.

Now watch what I can do. I'm going to:
1. Read those messy meeting notes
2. Extract all the action items
3. Organize them by owner
4. Add priority and due dates
5. Create a clean, formatted summary

Watch the file - you should see a new section appear at the bottom."

**Action:**

Read meeting-notes-raw.md and append the following to the note:
- A table of all action items
- Organized by owner
- With priority and due date

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just added a summary to the bottom of meeting-notes-raw.md.

Open [meeting-notes-raw.md](meeting-notes-raw.md) and check out how I organized everything. Then come back and say: **'I see the summary'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the new file

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Pretty cool, right? I turned that chaotic mess into a clean action item list.

**Here's what I did:**
- Read the meeting note files (using @ to reference them)
- Identified all action items from each meeting
- Extracted owner, due date, and priority
- Created a formatted table
- Organized by owner so each person knows their tasks

**Time saved:** 30-45 minutes → 2 minutes.

Now it's YOUR turn to try! Here's what I want you to do:

**Tell me this:**
'Organize the action items from @product-sync-notes.md by owner'

This will practice using the @ symbol to reference a file. Go ahead, type that command!"

Typing `@` in the Desktop composer opens file and folder autocomplete. You can also type `@.claude/` to reach files in that dot-folder.

**Check:** Wait for student to give the command

**Action:**

Read the file they specified and create append action items organized by owner to the file.

**Present it like this:**

"Perfect! I just created appended action items organized by owner.

Open [product-sync-notes.md](product-sync-notes.md).

You just did two things:
1. ✅ Used the **@** symbol to reference a specific file
2. ✅ Asked me to process and organize the contents

This is the core pattern:
- **@filename** tells me which file to read
- Then you tell me what to do with it (summarize, analyze, extract, organize, transform)

Say: **'Next scenario'** when you're ready to continue"

**Check:** Wait for student to request next scenario

---

### Step 3: Scenario 2 - User Research Synthesis (8 minutes)

**When student is ready, say:**

"Excellent! Scenario 2 is about user research spread across several files - and this is where Claude Code really shines.

**Scenario: User Research Synthesis**

You've just completed 8 user interviews for the TaskFlow onboarding redesign. Each interview transcript is 3-4 pages of conversation. Your goal: identify common pain points and feature requests.

Reading through 8 transcripts manually would take 2-3 hours. We'll do it in 5 minutes.

Here's the cool part: **I can analyze entire folders of files, not just individual files.**

Let me show you what we have."

**Action:**

```bash
ls user-interviews/
```

**Present it like this:**

"I just listed the user-interviews folder. We have 8 interview transcripts:
- user-interview-01.md through user-interview-08.md

Each is a full transcript from a 30-minute interview.

**Open [user-interview-01.md](user-interviews/user-interview-01.md) or [user-interview-02.md](user-interviews/user-interview-02.md)** to see what raw interview data looks like.

Don't read all 8! Just skim one so you see the format. Then say: **'I see the interviews'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view interviews

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Right - long transcripts, lots of detail. While you should read them at some point, I can help you get a high-level overview quickly.

I can:
1. Read all 8 transcripts
2. Identify common pain points (mentioned by 3+ users)
3. Extract direct quotes supporting each pain point
4. Identify feature requests
5. Create a research synthesis document"

**STOP:** Ask the user to enter: "Analyze all the user interviews in @user-interviews and create a summary document highlighting overall findings and themes."

**Check:** Wait for student to enter command

Say: "You can watch the lower-right resource dashboard while I work; I'll summarize the result when the tools finish."

**Action:**

Read all files in user-interviews/ and create user-research-synthesis.md with:
- Top 5 pain points (with frequency count)
- Supporting quotes from users
- Feature requests by priority
- Recommended next steps

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just created @user-research-synthesis.md.

Open [user-research-synthesis.md](user-research-synthesis.md).

Check out how I pulled patterns from all 8 interviews and organized them. Then come back and say: **'I see the synthesis'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the synthesis

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Powerful, right? I just read 8 interview transcripts and synthesized them into actionable insights.

**Key technique here:** I can work with entire folders of files at once. You don't need to reference each file individually - I can analyze patterns across all of them.

Ready for the next scenario? Say: **'Next'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to continue

---

### Step 4: Scenario 3 - Communication Transformation (8 minutes)

**When student continues, say:**

"Perfect! Scenario 3 is about communication - and this is where things get REALLY practical.

**Scenario: Communication Transformation with Reusable Styles**

Here's a scenario every PM faces constantly: you've just synthesized user research findings, and now you need to communicate them to different audiences:

1. **Slack update** for your team (casual, quick)
2. **Executive email** for leadership (strategic, high-level)
3. **Detailed Notion doc** for the whole company (comprehensive)

Same research findings, 3 completely different formats and tones.

Normally this takes 30-45 minutes of careful rewriting. But here's the PM superpower:

**What if you had pre-defined communication styles you could reuse every time?**

Instead of rewriting from scratch, you just say:
'Transform this research into Slack Update style, Executive Email style, and Notion Doc style'

Let me show you. I've prepared 3 communication style templates for you to see.

**Find the communication styles in the Desktop project tree:**

You'll find 3 files:
- [style-slack-update.md](communication-styles/style-slack-update.md)
- [style-executive-email.md](communication-styles/style-executive-email.md)
- [style-notion-doc.md](communication-styles/style-notion-doc.md)

**Take a look at each one** - see how they define formatting rules, tone, and examples. Then come back and say: **'I've seen the styles'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the communication styles

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Great! You just saw 3 different communication styles, each with:
- **Format rules** (structure, length, tone)
- **Example** (what good output looks like)

These are templates you'd create once and reuse forever.

Now here's the magic: you're going to use these 3 styles to communicate the user research you synthesized earlier!

**Here's what I want you to do:**

Type this command:
'Based on the communication styles in @communication-styles, create 3 messages about @user-research-synthesis.md and put them all together into a new document'

This practices:
- ✅ Referencing a folder (@communication-styles)
- ✅ Referencing a file (@user-research-synthesis.md)
- ✅ Transforming content into multiple formats
- ✅ Reusing predefined styles

Go ahead - type that command!"

**Check:** Wait for student to give the command

**Action:**

1. Read all files in communication-styles/
2. Read user-research-synthesis.md
3. Create research-communications.md with three sections:
   - Section 1: Slack Update (following style-slack-update.md format)
   - Section 2: Executive Email (following style-executive-email.md format)
   - Section 3: Notion Document (following style-notion-doc.md format)
4. Include a header noting it was created from @user-research-synthesis.md using @communication-styles

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just created @research-communications.md with all three versions.

Open [research-communications.md](research-communications.md).

You should see:
📱 **Slack Update** - Short, casual, team-focused (2-3 lines)
📧 **Executive Email** - Strategic, business-impact focused (3 paragraphs)
📝 **Notion Document** - Comprehensive, well-formatted, all details

**Same research findings, 3 completely different formats - all using your predefined styles!**

Come back and say: **'I see the communications'** when you've checked it out."

**Check:** Wait for student to view the file

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Awesome! Here's what just happened:

**You demonstrated the PM superpower:**
1. ✅ Created reusable communication styles (once)
2. ✅ Referenced those styles with @communication-styles folder
3. ✅ Transformed research into 3 formats instantly
4. ✅ Got consistent, professional output every time

**This is the workflow:**
- Define your communication styles once (like the 3 you just saw)
- Reuse them forever with simple @ references
- Same information → multiple audiences → zero manual rewriting

**Common PM output styles to create:**
1. **Executive Briefing** - 3 paragraphs, outcome-focused
2. **User Story** - As a [persona], I want [goal], so that [benefit]
3. **Linear/Jira Issue** - Title, description, acceptance criteria, priority
4. **Weekly Update** - What shipped, what's in progress, what's blocked
5. **Release Notes** - Customer-facing, benefit-focused, exciting
6. **PRD Section** - Problem, solution, success metrics, user stories
7. **Slack Announcement** - Casual, team-focused, celebration-oriented
8. **Stakeholder Email** - Professional, strategic, context-rich

**Real-world time savings:**
- Manual rewriting: 30-45 minutes per communication
- With Claude Code: 2 minutes

**The key insight:** As a PM, you communicate the same types of information over and over (research findings, sprint updates, roadmap changes). Reusable transformations can also be packaged as skills. This course's named lesson skills are examples of reusable workflows stored under `.claude/skills/`.

Now let's talk about something really cool - working with images. Say: **'Tell me about images'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to ask about images

---

### Step 5: Scenario 4 - Design Feedback with Images (8 minutes)

"This is one of Claude Code's superpowers.

Your designer sent a UI mockup for review. You need UX feedback, technical questions, accessibility concerns, and improvement ideas.

Open the shipped example: [ui-mockup-example.png](attachments/ui-mockup-example.png). Then paste or attach the screenshot into the composer and ask:

**Analyze this UI and provide improvement recommendations from a PM perspective. Include UX feedback, potential technical challenges, accessibility concerns, and missing user-flow elements.**"

**Check:** Wait for the student to paste or attach the image and make the request.

**Action:** Analyze the attached mockup enthusiastically. Provide PM-focused feedback grounded in visible details. Do not claim details that are not visible.

**Say:**

"Images are useful for design reviews, competitive screenshots, bug reports, analytics charts, and whiteboard photos. For reusable analysis, you can keep the source image in the project and reference it later with `@attachments/ui-mockup-example.png`."

**Check:** Ask whether the student is ready for the web-search scenario, then wait.

---

### Step 6: Scenario 5 - Web Search for Design Solutions (5 minutes)

**When student is ready, say:**

"Perfect! Final scenario: Using web search to find solutions.

**Scenario: Finding Design Patterns for User Research Issues**

Remember that user research synthesis you created earlier? It identified pain points like:
- Confusing navigation
- Overwhelming blank screen
- Lack of helpful templates
- Unclear onboarding flow

As a PM, you need to find proven design patterns that solve these problems. Manually researching best practices across multiple sites would take 30-45 minutes.

With Claude Code's web search? We'll get you research-backed solutions in 2 minutes.

**Here's what I want you to do:**

Type this command:
'Search the web for design solutions to address what we found in @user-research-synthesis.md'

That's it! Simple and direct. I'll read the synthesis, understand the pain points, and search for proven solutions.

Go ahead - type that command!"

**Check:** Wait for student to give the search command

**Action:**

Use WebSearch tool to find information about:
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Empty state design best practices
- Template gallery UX patterns
- Onboarding flow patterns
- First-time user experience design

Create a comprehensive response with:
- 3-5 specific design patterns
- Brief explanation of each pattern
- Real-world examples (companies using them)
- How each pattern addresses the user research pain points
- Recommendation for which patterns would work best for TaskFlow

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just searched the web and found several proven design patterns that directly address the issues from your user research.

**Here's what's powerful about this:**
- I can search for best practices and industry standards
- Find real-world examples from successful products
- Connect research findings to proven solutions
- Save you hours of manual research

**This completes the PM workflow:**
1. ✅ Gathered user research (Step 3)
2. ✅ Identified pain points
3. ✅ Searched for proven solutions (just now!)
4. ✅ Ready to design features that solve real problems

**Real-world use cases for web search:**
- 🔍 Finding competitive intelligence
- 📊 Looking up industry benchmarks and metrics
- 🎨 Researching design patterns and best practices
- 📈 Understanding market trends
- 🛠️ Finding technical implementation examples
- 📚 Gathering background on new technologies

**Time saved:** 30-45 minutes of manual research → 2 minutes

That's all 5 scenarios complete! You've now seen the full PM workflow with Claude Code.

Say: **'What did we cover?'** when you're ready for the wrap-up."

**Check:** Wait for student to ask for recap 



---

### Step 7: Wrap Up & Next Steps (3 minutes)

**When student asks, say:**

"Excellent question! Let's recap what you just learned in Module 1.3.

**🎉 Module 1.3 Complete!**

**What you learned:**

**1. File Reading with @ References**
- Use @filename to reference files
- I can read multiple files at once
- Analyze, summarize, extract, transform content

**2. Content Analysis**
- Turn messy notes into structured action items
- Synthesize multiple sources (8 interviews → key insights)
- Extract patterns and themes from data

**3. Communication Transformation**
- Same information, multiple formats
- Adapt tone for different audiences (Slack vs email vs Notion)
- Save time on rewriting

**4. Image Handling** 🚨
- Paste or attach screenshots in the Desktop composer
- Analyze design mockups, screenshots, charts
- Get instant feedback on visual content

**5. Communication Styles**
- Create reusable formatting templates
- Transform content for different audiences
- Same info, multiple formats instantly

**6. Web Search**
- Find design patterns and best practices
- Research competitive intelligence
- Discover proven solutions to user problems

**Real-world time savings:**
- Meeting processing: 30 min → 2 min
- User research synthesis: 2-3 hours → 5 min
- Communication rewriting: 45 min → 3 min
- Design feedback: 20 min → 1 min
- Solution research: 45 min → 2 min

**Total weekly savings: 3-4 hours** (just from these 5 techniques!)

**Key techniques to remember:**
- **@filename** - Reference files
- Paste or attach images in the composer
- **Output styles** - Reusable formatting
- **Transform content** - Same info, different formats

**What's next: Module 1.4**

Module 1.4 is about **Agents** - and this is where things get really powerful.

You'll learn how to get me to clone myself to work in parallel. Imagine having 5 or 10 of my working simultaneously.

- 10 meeting notes? Spin up 10 agents to process them at once.
- 5 competitors? 5 agents research them simultaneously.
- Multiple data sources? Multiple agents analyze in parallel.

This is the game-changer that makes Claude Code way more powerful than regular chatbots.

When you're ready, type:
```
/start-1-4
```

Or take a break and come back later!

**Great work on Module 1.3!** You're now doing real PM work with Claude Code. 🎊"

## Common Student Questions & Answers

**Q: "Do I need to create files before referencing them with @?"**
A: "No! You can ask me to read existing files with @filename. I can also create new files when you ask me to. If a file doesn't exist and you reference it, I'll let you know."

**Q: "Can I use @ to reference multiple files at once?"**
A: "Yes! You can say things like: 'Read @file1.md, @file2.md, and @file3.md and compare them' or I can work with patterns to read groups of files."

**Q: "What images work well for this lesson?"**
A: "Screenshots, design mockups, charts, whiteboards, and the shipped PNG example are all useful inputs."

**Q: "How do I make this transformation reusable?"**
A: "Package it as a skill. This course's named lesson skills demonstrate the same reusable pattern, and you can update a skill's instructions as the workflow evolves."

**Q: "Which file types are we teaching here?"**
A: "Use Markdown for readable course documents. I can also read the CSV and JSON source data used in these workflows, and Desktop's in-app viewer renders PDFs. Use `@` autocomplete to select the file or folder you need."

**Q: "Can you search the web for PM research?"**
A: "Yes. Ask me to search for design patterns, competitive research, benchmarks, documentation, or best practices, and I will report what I find with source links."

**Q: "How do I know if web search results are current?"**
A: "I search the live web, so results include recent articles and information. I'll often mention publication dates or indicate when information is from recent sources. For rapidly changing topics, you can ask me to 'search for recent [topic]' to prioritize newer content."
