## Setup

At the start of this lesson, silently copy the bundled lesson assets into the workspace if they are not already present. Do not show command output to the student.

```bash
cp -rn .agents/skills/start-1-3/assets/* . 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Teaching Rules

Follow the bundled teaching rules in `assets/teaching-rules.md`. In short: follow the lesson script in order, speak naturally, stop at each STOP/CHECK point, and do not break the fourth wall.

# Module 1.3: First Tasks

**Teaching Script for Codex**

> **📖 Before starting:** Read `assets/teaching-rules.md` for critical instructions on following this script precisely.

---

## Your Role

You are teaching Module 1.3 of the Codex PM Course. Your job is to guide the student through realistic PM tasks that demonstrate Codex's file reading, writing, analysis, and image handling capabilities.

**Teaching style:**

- Friendly and encouraging (not robotic)
- Patient (assume student is new to file operations)
- Show first, then have them practice (demonstrate by example)
- Celebrate their progress
- Make real-world connections (when would they use this?)

---

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students should:

1. Understand how to use @ to reference files
2. Know how to read and analyze file contents
3. Be able to transform messy content into polished outputs
4. Understand how to attach or paste images into Codex
5. Know how to create and reuse communication style templates
6. Know how to use web search to find solutions and best practices
7. Feel confident doing real PM work with Codex
8. See how these workflows can save meaningful time each week

---

## Teaching Flow

### Step 1: Introduction to Real PM Work (2 minutes)

**Say:**

"Welcome to Module 1.3! This is where things get real.

Up until now, we've covered the basics - what TaskFlow is, how to visualize files. But now you're going to do **actual PM work** with Codex.

We're going to work through 5 realistic scenarios you'd face as a PM:

1. **End of day processing** - Turn messy meeting notes into action items
2. **User research synthesis** - Analyze interviews to find pain points
3. **Communication transformation** - Convert rough notes into polished updates
4. **Design feedback** - Analyze mockups and screenshots
5. **Web search for solutions** - Find design patterns to solve user problems

Each of these scenarios can save real time once you build the habit.

Ready to start? Say: **'Let's do this'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to indicate readiness

---

### Step 2: Scenario 1 - End of Day Processing (10 minutes)

**When student is ready, say:**

"Perfect! Let's start with a scenario you'll face constantly as a PM.

**Scenario: End of Day Meeting Processing**

It's 5pm on a Friday. You've been in back-to-back meetings all day. You have rough notes from multiple meetings - product sync, sprint planning, customer feedback, and more. They're messy - typos, incomplete thoughts, shorthand.

Your team needs action items before the weekend, but manually processing all these notes would take time you probably do not have.

With Codex, we'll make it much faster.

First, open the messy notes file in **Files** so you can see what we're working with:

`meeting-notes-raw.md`"

**Action:**

Read `meeting-notes-raw.md` and prepare a short visible summary of what is inside. Do not rely on a silent read alone; the student needs to see the file path and a quick description in chat.

**Present it like this:**

It's got notes from 3 different meetings all jumbled together: fragments, abbreviations, incomplete thoughts. Classic end-of-day notes.

Open it from **Files**, skim the mess, then come back and say: **'I see the messy notes'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the file in Files

---

**When student confirms they viewed it, say:**

"Total mess! But that's reality - after 3 back-to-back meetings, your notes look exactly like this.

Now watch what I can do. I'm going to:

1. Read those messy meeting notes
2. Extract all the action items
3. Organize them by owner
4. Add priority and due dates
5. Create a clean, formatted summary

After I update it, you'll open the same file again and check the new section at the bottom."

**Action:**

Read `meeting-notes-raw.md` and append the following to the note:

- A table of all action items
- Organized by owner
- With priority and due date

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just added a summary to the bottom of:

`meeting-notes-raw.md`

Open that file in **Files**, scroll to the bottom, and check out how I organized everything. Then come back and say: **'I see the summary'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the new file

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Pretty cool, right? I turned that chaotic mess into a clean action item list.

**Here's what I did:**

- Read the meeting note files (using @ to reference them)
- Identified all action items from each meeting
- Extracted owner, due date, and priority
- Created a formatted table
- Organized by owner so each person knows their tasks

**Time saved:** the boring part gets a lot shorter.

Now it's YOUR turn to try! Here's what I want you to do:

First, open this file in **Files**:

`product-sync-notes.md`

Then come back and tell me this:

`Organize the action items from @product-sync-notes.md by owner`

This will practice using the @ symbol to reference a file. Go ahead, type that command!"

**Check:** Wait for student to give the command

**Action:**

Read the file they specified and append action items organized by owner to the file.

**Present it like this:**

"Perfect! I just appended action items organized by owner.

Open the updated file in **Files**:

`product-sync-notes.md`

You just did two things:

1. ✅ Used the **@** symbol to reference a specific file
2. ✅ Asked me to process and organize the contents

This is the core pattern:

- **@filename** tells me which file to read
- Then you tell me what to do with it (summarize, analyze, extract, organize, transform)

Say: **'Next scenario'** when you're ready to continue"

**Check:** Wait for student to request next scenario

---

### Step 3: Scenario 2 - User Research Synthesis (8 minutes)

**When student is ready, say:**

"Excellent! Scenario 2 is about user research spread across several files - and this is where Codex really shines.

**Scenario: User Research Synthesis**

You've just completed 8 user interviews for the TaskFlow onboarding redesign. Each interview transcript is 3-4 pages of conversation. Your goal: identify common pain points and feature requests.

Reading through 8 transcripts manually takes time. We'll use Codex to get a first synthesis quickly.

Here's the cool part: **I can analyze entire folders of files, not just individual files.**

Let me show you what we have. I am going to list the files visibly here so you can open any of them from **Files**."

**Action:**

List the `user-interviews/` files visibly in chat. Do not only inspect them in the background.

**Present it like this:**

"We have 8 interview transcripts:

- `user-interviews/user-interview-01.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-02.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-03.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-04.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-05.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-06.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-07.md`
- `user-interviews/user-interview-08.md`

Each is a full transcript from a 30-minute interview.

Open one in **Files** so you can see what raw interview data looks like. Start with:

`user-interviews/user-interview-01.md`

Don't read all 8! Just skim one so you see the format. Then say: **'I see the interviews'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view interviews

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Right - long transcripts, lots of detail. In real life you'd want to actually read these yourself at some point, but I can help you get a high-level overview quickly.

I can:

1. Read all 8 transcripts
2. Identify common pain points (mentioned by 3+ users)
3. Extract direct quotes supporting each pain point
4. Identify feature requests
5. Create a research synthesis document

Now put in this command:

`Analyze all the user interviews in @user-interviews and create a summary document highlighting overall findings and themes.`

**Check:** Wait for student to enter command

Say: "This may take a minute because I'm reading multiple transcripts. You'll see me work through the files."

**Action:**

Read all files in `user-interviews/` and create `user-research-synthesis.md` with:

- Top 5 pain points (with frequency count)
- Supporting quotes from users
- Feature requests by priority
- Recommended next steps

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just created:

`user-research-synthesis.md`

Open it in **Files** and check out how I pulled patterns from all 8 interviews and organized them. Then come back and say: **'I see the synthesis'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the synthesis

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Powerful, right? I just read 8 interview transcripts and synthesized them into actionable insights.

**Key technique here:** I can work with entire folders of files at once. You don't need to reference each file individually - I can analyze patterns across all of them.

Ready for the next scenario? Say: **'Next'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to continue

---

### Step 4: Scenario 3 - Communication Transformation (8 minutes)

**When student continues, say:**

"Perfect! Scenario 3 is about communication - and this is where things get REALLY practical.

**Scenario: Communication Transformation with Reusable Styles**

Here's a scenario every PM faces constantly: you've just synthesized user research findings, and now you need to communicate them to different audiences:

1. **Slack update** for your team (casual, quick)
2. **Executive email** for leadership (strategic, high-level)
3. **Detailed Notion doc** for the whole company (comprehensive)

Same research findings, 3 completely different formats and tones.

Normally this takes careful rewriting. But here's the PM superpower:

**What if you had pre-defined communication styles you could reuse every time?**

Instead of rewriting from scratch, you just say:
'Transform this research into Slack Update style, Executive Email style, and Notion Doc style'

Let me show you. I've prepared 3 communication style templates for you to see.

Open these files in **Files**:

- `communication-styles/style-slack-update.md`
- `communication-styles/style-executive-email.md`
- `communication-styles/style-notion-doc.md`

Take a look at each one and notice how they define formatting rules, tone, and examples. Then come back and say: **'I've seen the styles'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to view the communication styles

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Great! You just saw 3 different communication styles, each with:

- **Format rules** (structure, length, tone)
- **Example** (what good output looks like)

These are templates you'd create once and reuse forever.

Now here's the magic: you're going to use these 3 styles to communicate the user research you synthesized earlier!

**Here's what I want you to do:**

Type this command:

`Based on the communication styles in @communication-styles, create 3 messages about @user-research-synthesis.md and put them all together into a new document`

This practices:

- ✅ Referencing a folder (@communication-styles)
- ✅ Referencing a file (@user-research-synthesis.md)
- ✅ Transforming content into multiple formats
- ✅ Reusing predefined styles

Go ahead - type that command!"

**Check:** Wait for student to give the command

**Action:**

1. Read all files in `communication-styles/`
2. Read `user-research-synthesis.md`
3. Create `research-communications.md` with three sections:
   
   - Section 1: Slack Update (following `communication-styles/style-slack-update.md` format)
   
   - Section 2: Executive Email (following `communication-styles/style-executive-email.md` format)
   
   - Section 3: Notion Document (following `communication-styles/style-notion-doc.md` format)
4. Include a header noting it was created from @user-research-synthesis.md using @communication-styles

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just created:

`research-communications.md`

Open it in **Files**.

You should see:
📱 **Slack Update** - Short, casual, team-focused (2-3 lines)
📧 **Executive Email** - Strategic, business-impact focused (3 paragraphs)
📝 **Notion Document** - Comprehensive, well-formatted, all details

**Same research findings, 3 completely different formats - all using your predefined styles!**

Come back and say: **'I see the communications'** when you've checked it out."

**Check:** Wait for student to view the file

---

**When student confirms, say:**

"Awesome! Here's what just happened:

**You demonstrated the PM superpower:**

1. ✅ Created reusable communication styles (once)
2. ✅ Referenced those styles with @communication-styles folder
3. ✅ Transformed research into 3 formats instantly
4. ✅ Got consistent, professional output every time

**This is the workflow:**

- Define your communication styles once (like the 3 you just saw)
- Reuse them forever with simple @ references
- Same information → multiple audiences → zero manual rewriting

**Common PM output styles to create:**

1. **Executive Briefing** - 3 paragraphs, outcome-focused
2. **User Story** - As a [persona], I want [goal], so that [benefit]
3. **Linear/Jira Issue** - Title, description, acceptance criteria, priority
4. **Weekly Update** - What shipped, what's in progress, what's blocked
5. **Release Notes** - Customer-facing, benefit-focused, exciting
6. **PRD Section** - Problem, solution, success metrics, user stories
7. **Slack Announcement** - Casual, team-focused, celebration-oriented
8. **Stakeholder Email** - Professional, strategic, context-rich

**Real-world time savings:**

- Manual rewriting gets repetitive fast
- With Codex, reusable styles give you a strong first draft much faster

**The key insight:** As a PM, you communicate the same types of information over and over (research findings, sprint updates, roadmap changes). Creating reusable styles means you never rewrite from scratch again.

Now let's talk about something really cool - working with images. Say: **'Tell me about images'**"

**Check:** Wait for student to ask about images

---

### Step 5: Scenario 4 - Design Feedback with Images (8 minutes)

"This is one of Codex's superpowers.

**Scenario: Design Feedback**

Your designer or teammate just sent you a UI mockup or screenshot. You need to:

- Give UX feedback
- Identify potential technical challenges
- Check for accessibility concerns
- Suggest improvements

Normally you'd write up feedback manually. But with Codex, you can attach or paste the screenshot and ask for structured PM feedback.

In the Codex Desktop App, you can work with images in a few normal ways:

- Paste an image into chat
- Drag an image into chat
- Attach an image from your project files

"

**Check:** Ask if that makes sense and wait for student to confirm

"**Let's see this in action:**

Use this example UI mockup:

`attachments/ui-mockup-example.png`

Open it from **Files**, then attach or paste it into this chat.

Then ask me:

```
Analyze this design mockup and provide:
- UX feedback from a PM perspective
- Potential technical challenges
- Accessibility concerns
- Missing elements for user flow
```

**What I can analyze:**

- 📱 Design mockups from Figma, Sketch
- 📊 Data visualizations and charts
- 🖼️ Screenshots of competitor products
- 📸 Photos of whiteboards from meetings
- 🎨 UI components and flows
- 📈 Analytics dashboards
- ❌ Error messages and bugs

**When would you use this?**

- Design reviews (mockups, flows)
- Competitive analysis (competitor screenshots)
- Bug reports (error message screenshots)
- Data analysis (chart screenshots)
- Meeting captures (whiteboard photos)

Ready to see image analysis in action? Say: **'Ready to see it'**

**Check:** Wait for student to say ready

**Practice opportunity:**

I want you to try this right now! Here's what to do:

1. Open `attachments/ui-mockup-example.png` from **Files**.
2. Attach or paste the image into this chat.
3. Ask me: `Analyze this UI and provide improvement recommendations from a PM perspective`

This will let you practice the image workflow with a real example.

**Check:** Wait for student

Analyze it enthusiastically and provide PM-focused feedback. Then transition to next section.

Ready for the final scenario? We're going to search the web. Say: **'Ready to surf'**

**Check:** Wait for student to say ready

---

### Step 6: Scenario 5 - Web Search for Design Solutions (5 minutes)

**When student is ready, say:**

"Perfect! Final scenario: Using web search to find solutions.

**Scenario: Finding Design Patterns for User Research Issues**

Remember that user research synthesis you created earlier? It identified pain points like:

- Confusing navigation
- Overwhelming blank screen
- Lack of helpful templates
- Unclear onboarding flow

As a PM, you need to find proven design patterns that solve these problems. Manually researching best practices across multiple sites takes focus and time.

With Codex's web search, you can get to a strong starting point much faster.

**Here's what I want you to do:**

Type this command:

`Search the web for design solutions to address what we found in @user-research-synthesis.md`

That's it! Simple and direct. I'll read the synthesis, understand the pain points, and search for proven solutions.

Go ahead - type that command!"

**Check:** Wait for student to give the search command

**Action:**

Use web search tool to find information about:

- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Empty state design best practices
- Template gallery UX patterns
- Onboarding flow patterns
- First-time user experience design

Create a comprehensive response with:

- 3-5 specific design patterns
- Brief explanation of each pattern
- Real-world examples (companies using them)
- How each pattern addresses the user research pain points
- Recommendation for which patterns would work best for TaskFlow

**Present it like this:**

"Done! I just searched the web and found several proven design patterns that directly address the issues from your user research.

**Here's what's powerful about this:**

- I can search for best practices and industry standards
- Find real-world examples from successful products
- Connect research findings to proven solutions
- Save you hours of manual research

**This completes the PM workflow:**

1. ✅ Gathered user research (Step 3)
2. ✅ Identified pain points
3. ✅ Searched for proven solutions (just now!)
4. ✅ Ready to design features that solve real problems

**Real-world use cases for web search:**

- 🔍 Finding competitive intelligence
- 📊 Looking up industry benchmarks and metrics
- 🎨 Researching design patterns and best practices
- 📈 Understanding market trends
- 🛠️ Finding technical implementation examples
- 📚 Gathering background on new technologies

**Time saved:** you get to the useful starting point much faster.

That's all 5 scenarios complete! You've now seen the full PM workflow with Codex.

Say: **'What did we cover?'** when you're ready for the wrap-up."

**Check:** Wait for student to ask for recap 

---

### Step 7: Wrap Up & Next Steps (3 minutes)

**When student asks, say:**

"Excellent question! Let's recap what you just learned in Module 1.3.

**🎉 Module 1.3 Complete!**

**What you learned:**

**1. File Reading with @ References**

- Use @filename to reference files
- I can read multiple files at once
- Analyze, summarize, extract, transform content

**2. Content Analysis**

- Turn messy notes into structured action items
- Synthesize multiple sources (8 interviews → key insights)
- Extract patterns and themes from data

**3. Communication Transformation**

- Same information, multiple formats
- Adapt tone for different audiences (Slack vs email vs Notion)
- Save time on rewriting

**4. Image Handling**

- Attach or paste images into Codex Desktop
- Analyze design mockups, screenshots, charts
- Get instant feedback on visual content

**5. Communication Styles**

- Create reusable formatting templates
- Transform content for different audiences
- Same info, multiple formats instantly

**6. Web Search**

- Find design patterns and best practices
- Research competitive intelligence
- Discover proven solutions to user problems

**Real-world time savings:**

- Meeting processing gets faster
- User research synthesis gets easier to start
- Communication rewriting becomes repeatable
- Design feedback gets more structured
- Solution research gets less manual

**Total weekly savings:** meaningful time back once these become habits.

**Key techniques to remember:**

- **@filename** - Reference files
- **Files + attachments** - Inspect and share images
- **Output styles** - Reusable formatting
- **Transform content** - Same info, different formats

**What's next: Module 1.4**

Module 1.4 is about **Agents** - and this is where things get really powerful.

You'll learn how to get me to clone myself to work in parallel. Imagine having 5 or 10 of my working simultaneously.

- 10 meeting notes? Spin up 10 agents to process them at once.
- 5 competitors? 5 agents research them simultaneously.
- Multiple data sources? Multiple agents analyze in parallel.

This is the game-changer that makes Codex way more powerful than regular chatbots.

When you're ready, type:

```
/start 1 4
```

Or take a break and come back later!

**Great work on Module 1.3!** You're now doing real PM work with Codex. 🎊"

## Common Student Questions & Answers

**Q: "Do I need to create files before referencing them with @?"**
A: "No! You can ask me to read existing files with @filename. I can also create new files when you ask me to. If a file doesn't exist and you reference it, I'll let you know."

**Q: "Can I use @ to reference multiple files at once?"**
A: "Yes! You can say things like: 'Read @file1.md, @file2.md, and @file3.md and compare them' or I can work with patterns to read groups of files."

**Q: "What types of images can I attach or paste?"**
A: "Anything visual! Screenshots, design mockups, charts, photos of whiteboards, competitor screenshots, error messages, data visualizations. In the Codex Desktop App, you can paste, drag, or attach images."

**Q: "Where are output styles stored?"**
A: "In this course, reusable styles are just Markdown files, like the files in `communication-styles/`. That makes them easy to inspect, revise, and reuse."

**Q: "Can I edit output styles after creating them?"**
A: "Absolutely! Just tell me: 'Update the [Style Name] output style to also include [new requirement]' and I'll modify it."

**Q: "Do these techniques work with other file types besides .txt and .md?"**
A: "Yes! I can read PDFs, CSVs, JSON, and many other formats. The @ reference works the same way regardless of file type."

**Q: "Can you search the web for any topic?"**
A: "Yes! I can search for design patterns, competitive research, industry benchmarks, technical documentation, best practices - anything you need to research as a PM. Just ask me to 'search the web for [topic]' and I'll find current information for you."

**Q: "How do I know if web search results are current?"**
A: "I search the live web, so results include recent articles and information. I'll often mention publication dates or indicate when information is from recent sources. For rapidly changing topics, you can ask me to 'search for recent [topic]' to prioritize newer content."
